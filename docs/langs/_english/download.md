### Difference between Standard / Full Edition
{: .doc-sec1 }

v1.8.0 and later version have two editions, Standard Edition and Full Edition.

The only difference between the editions is the behavior during hand tracking.

In Standard Edition, you will see the special post-process effect during image based hand tracking enabled.
Full Edition does not have those restriction, so that you can use hand tracking feature completely.

(Left: Standard Edition / Right: Full Edition)

<div class="row">
{% include docimg.html file="./images/docs/hand_tracking_edition_difference.png" customclass="col s12 m6 l6" imgclass="fit-doc-img" %}
</div>

All other features works same in both editions.

In most cases standard edition will be enough for what you need.
When you consider to get the full edition, please understand that the price assumes the value of rather the whole software than hand tracking feature itself. 

Of course there are additional meaning like sharewere / donation, and they will be powerful motivation for the app maintenance.
